Where I live I have two choices in making Sauerbraten [^1], either buy the meat in marinade, either at the butcher or even an Aldi store, or marinade myself.\n\nThe store bought meat is often on the sour side, so part of the fun in doing your own is to tone down the sourness a bit and amp up the spices.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Marinade\n\n1 carrot, leek, celeriac     \n1 large onion     \n1 tbsp sugar     \n150 ml red wine vinegar      \n1 bottle dry red wine      \n1 tsp juniper berries     \n1 tsp black pepper berries      \n1 tsp all spice berries      \n3 dried bay leaves or 5 - 6 fresh ones     \n2 clovers      \n1 star anis      \n1 ½ kg braising beef     \n\n### Braising\n\n3 tbsp lard     \nsalt      \npepper      \n2 tbsp tomato puree     \n800 ml beef broth      \n100 g Schwarzbrot or Pumpernickel      \n50 g raisins      \n50 ml Rübenkraut (sugar beet syrup)     \n2 tbsp cold butter     \n200 ml cream, sour cream or creme fraiche     \n\n## Method\n\nCaramelise the sugar and deglaze with the vinegar. Add the red wine and spices, add the onion cut into eighths and carrot, leek and celeriac cut into 5 mm cubes. Bring to a boil and let cool.\n\nWhen cold add the beef and marinade for 5 to 6 days, turning daily.\n\nAfter marinading dry the beef and brown from all sides in hot lard. Reserve about 500 ml of the marinade, having sieved out the solids. Add the tomato puree.\n\nCover the raisins with apple juice or water\n\nAfter browning add the reserved marinade and the beef broth, the beet syrup, salt, pepper and the Schwarzbrot (it will desolve while braising).

Season to taste. If the sauce is not sour enough add some more vinegar, if it is to sour, add some more of the beet syrup [^2]. Add the raisins.\n\nServe with spätzle, noodles, mash or potatoes.\n\n*Traditionally this is farmers fare.
